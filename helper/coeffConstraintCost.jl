# This function evaluates and returns the coefficients for constraints and cost which are used later in the MPC formulation
# Inputs are:
# oldTraj   -> contains information about previous trajectories and Inputs
# mpcCoeff  -> contains information about previous coefficient results
# posInfo   -> contains information about the car's current position along the track
# mpcParams -> contains information about the MPC formulation (e.g. Q, R)
# stateIn   -> current state of the car
# inputIn   -> last input to the system

# structure of oldTrajectory: 1st dimension = state number, 2nd dimension = step number (time equiv.), 3rd dimennsion = lap number
