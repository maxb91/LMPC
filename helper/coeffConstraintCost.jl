# mpcCoeff  -> contains information about previous coefficient results
# posInfo   -> contains information about the car's current position along the track
# mpcParams -> contains information about the MPC formulation (e.g. Q, R)
# stateIn   -> current state of the car
# inputIn   -> last input to the system
